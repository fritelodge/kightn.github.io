<h2>My father intilled a strong work ethic in me at an early age. I often spent my weekends fixing cars, digging graves, pouring cement, and splitting wood with him. Growing up on the more
rural side of Indy, I was no stranger to hard work and often spent my days tending to my gardens, chickens, and goats. I volunteered at my local elementery school, teaching dance to an after school club during my middle school years.
During high school I worked evenings as a waitress down the street from where I grew up. In my senior year, I worked as an overnight cashier at Kohl's then later as a deli clerk at Kroger.
While these first jobs may have been simple, they taught me so much about teamwork, responsibility, and communication. They also inspired me to push myself, so that I could achieve great things and
become my own boss some day.<br> I started my current job at Menards at the beginning of 2016. My responsibilities include working with customers, running paint mixing machines,
constant problem solving, and filling in for managers in the evenings. The thing I enjoy the most about my current job is the constant challenge- every day I learn something new
and every day I have to come up with a plan that may or may not work. As the main paint mixer for my shift, I get a lot of creative freedom that comes in handy when trying to match colors.
<br>I am also employed with the University of Indianapolis as a part of a three person team creating softeare for the physical therapy department. My job in this project includes
creating interactive and animated 3D models to simulate a physical therapy patient. This is a work in progress that constantly has me learning and broadening my horizons. </h2>
