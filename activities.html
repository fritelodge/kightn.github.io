<h2 align="left">I like to think of myself as a well rounded individual. As a young girl, I would often hunt deer and attend dance class on the same day. However, I have been a true nerd since day one.
Throughout elementery school I competed with my chess club and math pentathelon team. In intermediate school, I participated in a stock market simulating club. I began playing
the violin the summer after fourth grade and continued up until I began high school, picking up several other instruments along the way. In middle school I competed with my academic team for two years,
where we were quizzed on random facts. </h2><br><br><hr><br><h2> In high school, I spent my free time at 4Paws and Robotics clubs, as well as serving as a math and science tutor for my school in my junior and senior years.
Now, I spend what little free time I have reading and tinkering with my electronics. I have taught myself arduino coding and building and I am constantly finding new projects to work on. I also recently bought a 3D printer to produce my own arduino parts.</h2>
