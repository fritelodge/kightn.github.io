<h2>Welcome!<br>My Name is Natalie Kight and I am a student at the University of Indianapolis. 
I am majoring in Digital Media Studies with a concentration in programming while minoring in Computer Science. I immediately knew that Digital Media
Studies was for me after exploring the interdisciplinary courses that I would take to prepare me for a career in technology. 
From Photoshop and Blogging to Graphic User Interfaces, I've already covered a lot in the past couple years and plan on graduating in 2018.<br>
I became interested in computers at a very young age. I began reading around age 3 and started collecting computer games that fed my reading addiction.
When we finally got dial up in the early 2000s, I was amazed with how much the internet had to offer me; I began begging my mom to let me have my own "dot com"
and around second grade, I recieved a book on HTML. In the fourth grade I published my first website (thanks to comcast personal pages) and I was hooked to say the least.
Throughout intermediate and Middle School, I took as many math and computer classes as possible. I was the editor of my middle school's yearbook commity and participated in our Academic Team for two years.
I also completed my first two years of high school level math classes during this time. <br> In high school I took four more math classes, as well as mass media, typing, HTML, 
photoshop and AP Computer Science classes. I remained on honor roll throughout all of middle and high school. In my senior year at Franklin Central
High School, I was lead programmer for my Vex Robotics team as I studied Robot C and other programming languages for Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
 I graduated from Franklin Central in 2015 with both Indiana Academic Honors and Franklin Central Academic Honors diplomas.</h2>
